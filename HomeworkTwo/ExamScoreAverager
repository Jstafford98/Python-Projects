def main():
  #Welcome Message
  print("===============================================")
  print(" Welcome to the exam score average calculator!")
  print("===============================================")
  #Instance Variable that will be used to track the total score of the exams
  cumulative_score = 0 ;
  #Prompt the user for total exams
  n_exams = eval(input("How many exam scores are there to be averaged? "))
  #Prompt user for indiviudal exam scores
  for i in range(n_exams):
    cumulative_score += eval(input("Enter exam score " + str(i+1) + ": "))
  #Display exam average to screen 
  print("Average Exam Score:",cumulative_score / n_exams)
