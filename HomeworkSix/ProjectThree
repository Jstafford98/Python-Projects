# Problem Statement: This program prints "Marching Ants" song
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. The main function will only call the print_song function. 
# 2. First, a header is printed
# 3. Next, a for loop is used to iterate the entire ten verses, calling the print_verse function passing i and the line width
# 4. With each call to the print_verse function, it will first print the "ants go marching" lines in their respective format using the value at index i in the numbers_list
# 5. Then, using the value at index i in the phrase list, the action of the little ant for that iteration is print
# 6. Finally, the static parts of the song are printed to the screen and the funciton returns
# 7. Once all ten verses are printed, the program will exit
#
# import the necessary python libraries
#     -None
