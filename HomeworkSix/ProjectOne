# Problem Statement: This program displays the area and radius of a sphere based on a user-provided radius
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. First, prompt the user to enter the radius of the sphere and store it in the radius variable
# 2. Next, display the Area and Volume using one print statement with formatting. The statement will call the sphereArea and sphereVolume functions.
#
# import the necessary python libraries
from math import pi

def main():
  radius = eval(input("Enter the radius of a sphere:"))
  print("Area: {0:^21.2f} \nVolume: {1:^17.2f}".format(sphereArea(radius),sphereVolume(radius)))

def sphereArea(radius):
  #4 * pi * r^2
  return 4 * pi * pow(radius,2) 
def sphereVolume(radius):
  #4/3 * pi * r^3
  return 4/3 * pi * pow(radius,3)

main()
