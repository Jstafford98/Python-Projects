# Problem Statement: This program prints the sum of number elements in a list
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1. First, declare a list of n numbers that we must sum up.
# 2. Next, call the sum_list function by passing it the number list from step 1.
# 3. sum_list will iterate through the list using a for loop, adding each value to the sum. 
# 4. Once complete, sum will be returned and printed to the console.
#
# import the necessary python libraries
#     -None

def main():
  numbers_list = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
  print(sum_list(numbers_list))

def sum_list(nums):
  cumulative_sum = 0
  for number in nums:
    cumulative_sum += number
  return cumulative_sum  

main()
